## Insurance Management System 
Under the guidance of Professor Dr. Ajay Gupta

Description

Traditionally, insurance companies have been limited in their ability to assess risk due to the narrow scope of data used to issue policies. However, by utilizing advanced telematic sensor data and cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, this project aims to revolutionize the insurance industry by providing agents with a more comprehensive set of tools for risk assessment.

Our project features a full-stack management system that allows insurance agents to access and visualize the telematic sensor data of their customers, including parameters such as extreme left and right turns, acceleration, braking activity, and days of the week driven, all in real-time on the user dashboard. This allows for more accurate and informed decision-making.

To predict the claim status, machine learning algorithms were employed and feature engineering was used to select the most relevant parameters such as driving duration, age, car age, credit score, annual miles driven, no-claim-years, total miles driven, braking activity, acceleration, and time-driven during rush hours. To improve the accuracy of the model, advanced oversampling and under-sampling techniques, such as the SMOTE and SMOTE-TOMEK methods, were used.

Overall, this project represents a bold step forward in the insurance industry, utilizing cutting-edge technology to provide insurance agents with the tools they need to make more informed and accurate risk assessments, ultimately leading to a more efficient and fair insurance system for all.
